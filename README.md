# Unit Converter

A **Unit Converter** application developed to perform conversions between various units such as length, weight, and temperature. 
The project provides a simple interface and ensures accurate results, making it useful for quick and efficient calculations.  

This project was created as part of my **Second Semester coursework**.

## Features
- Convert between multiple unit types:
  - Length (e.g., meters ↔ kilometers)  
  - Weight (e.g., grams ↔ kilograms)  
  - Temperature (e.g., Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)  
- User-friendly design and easy navigation  
- Accurate and efficient calculations

## Designed Overview
The Unit Converter was designed with a **modular approach** to ensure scalability and maintainability.  

- **Input Section**: Users can enter the value to be converted.  
- **Unit Selection**: Dropdown or selection mechanism to choose input and output units.  
- **Conversion Logic**: Backend logic handles precise calculations for different unit categories.  
- **Output Display**: Results are displayed instantly in a clear and readable format.  

This design ensures that additional unit categories can be integrated in future updates without disrupting the existing structure.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA

## Future Improvements
- Integration of additional unit categories (e.g., time, speed, area).  
- Improved graphical user interface.  
- Support for real-time conversions and enhanced usability.
