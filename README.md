# Unit Converter (Java CLI)

A simple and modular **Unit Converter** built in Java.  
This command-line tool provides conversion functionality across **Length**, **Weight**, and **Temperature** units.  
Designed with clean **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, the project is easy to extend and understand.
